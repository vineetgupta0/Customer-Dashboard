This implementation follows React and TypeScript best practices:

Uses functional components and hooks
Implements memoization for performance optimization
Uses custom hooks for data fetching and state management
Implements proper typing with TypeScript
Uses React.memo for optimizing re-renders of CustomerCard
Implements virtualization for the customer list (consider using react-window for large lists)
Fetches photos from a public API (Unsplash in this example)
Updates photos every 10 seconds

To further improve the application:

Implement proper error handling and loading states
Add unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
Implement server-side pagination for the customer list
Use a state management library like Redux or Recoil for more complex state management
Implement a design system or use a UI library like Material-UI for consistent styling
Add accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
Optimize for performance using React.lazy and Suspense for code-splitting

Remember to replace 'YOUR_UNSPLASH_API_KEY' with an actual API key from Unsplash or use another public API for fetching random images.
This implementation provides a solid foundation for the customer details portal. You can expand on this structure to add more features and refine the user interface as needed.

For better security 
Create a file named .env in your project root and add:
REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_actual_access_key_here
update your usePhotos.ts to use this environment variable:
const UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY = process.env.REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY;
 add .env to your .gitignore
